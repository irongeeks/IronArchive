decision:
  gate_status: PASS
  rationale: |
    The migration and test suite now satisfy all acceptance criteria, including the unified tenant credential column.
    Remaining work is limited to synchronizing architecture documentation so future readers see the updated contract.
  blocking_issues: 0
  recommended_action: "Update architecture docs to match the deployed schema; no further QA action required once documentation is refreshed."
