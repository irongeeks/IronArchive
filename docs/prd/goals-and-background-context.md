# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on your Project Brief, the primary goals for IronArchive are:

- **Cost Reduction:** Enable MSPs to reduce email archiving costs by 75% or more compared to commercial per-mailbox pricing (targeting $200/month infrastructure cost vs. $2,000+/month for 500 mailboxes)

- **Market Adoption:** Achieve 100 active installations within 6 months of v1.0 release, growing to 500+ installations within 18 months

- **Compliance Excellence:** Document and publish compliance mapping for DSGVO/GoBD and GDPR to enable MSPs to pass client audits with confidence

- **Community Building:** Establish an active contributor community with 20+ contributors, 1,000+ GitHub stars, and monthly community calls within 12 months

- **Superior User Experience:** Deliver instant search (< 200ms), intuitive multi-tenant management, and comprehensive whitelabeling that differentiates MSP offerings from competitors

- **Reliability & Trust:** Achieve 99.5% successful backup completion rate and 80% self-service resolution rate to minimize support burden

## Background Context

MSPs managing M365 email for multiple clients face critical challenges with current archiving solutions. European regulations (DSGVO/GoBD) require email retention for 6-10 years, yet commercial solutions like MailStore, Veeam, and Dropsuite charge per-mailbox monthly fees that can reach $2,000-5,000/month for an MSP managing 500 mailboxes across 20 clients. These solutions often suffer from slow search performance (30+ second queries), clunky multi-tenant management, and limited customization options.

**IronArchive** addresses this market gap as a modern, open-source, self-hosted M365 email archiving platform built specifically for MSPs serving multiple tenants. Leveraging Go 1.24, SvelteKit, and Meilisearch, IronArchive delivers enterprise-grade compliance features combined with instant search capabilities, true multi-tenant architecture, and comprehensive whitelabelingâ€”all deployable via Docker with zero licensing costs. The strategic decision to launch with a complete v1.0 feature set (rather than minimal MVP) reflects the competitive reality that MSPs will compare IronArchive directly to mature commercial products.
