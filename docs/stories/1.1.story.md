**Key Frontend Patterns:**
- Use Svelte stores for global state (auth, theme, active jobs)
- Use component-local reactive statements for UI-specific state
- Persist critical state (auth tokens, theme preference) to localStorage
- Use derived stores for computed values

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

### Docker Services Configuration

**Required Services for Docker Compose:**

1. **PostgreSQL 16** with pgcrypto, pg_cron extensions
2. **Redis 7** for cache & job queue
3. **Meilisearch 1.6** for full-text search

**Service Configuration Notes:**
- PostgreSQL: Expose port 5432, use volumes for data persistence
- Redis: Expose port 6379, use volumes for data persistence
- Meilisearch: Expose port 7700, requires MEILI_MASTER_KEY environment variable
- All services should have health checks configured

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]

### Environment Variables

**Critical Rule:** Access environment variables only through config objects, never `process.env` or `os.Getenv()` directly in business logic. Use dedicated config modules.

**Required Environment Variables for This Story:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/ironarchive`)
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string (e.g., `redis://localhost:6379`)
- `MEILISEARCH_URL`: Meilisearch endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:7700`)
- `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`: Meilisearch master key (e.g., `development_master_key`)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT token signing (for future stories)
- `SERVER_PORT`: Backend server port (default: `8080`)

**`.env.example` File Purpose:**
- Provides template for required environment variables
- Documents expected format and example values (non-sensitive)
- Helps developers set up local environment quickly
- Should NOT contain real credentials (use placeholder values)

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Logging Standards

**Backend Logging:**
- Use Zap logger for structured JSON logging
- Log format: JSON to stdout
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Machine-parseable, grep-friendly, supports log aggregation tools

**Connection Validation Logging:**
- Log successful connections at INFO level
- Log connection failures at ERROR level with error details
- Include service name and connection details (without credentials)

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Logging row]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Top-Level Makefile

**Purpose:** Provide convenient commands for common development tasks across the monorepo.

**Required Make Targets:**
- `dev`: Start development environment (docker services + backend + frontend)
- `test`: Run all tests (backend and frontend)
- `build`: Build both backend binary and frontend assets
- `migrate-up`: Run database migrations up
- `migrate-down`: Roll back database migrations
- `docker-up`: Start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Meilisearch)
- `docker-down`: Stop Docker services
- `clean`: Clean build artifacts

**Implementation Notes:**
- Makefile should work from repository root
- Use `cd` to navigate to backend/frontend subdirectories as needed
- Provide helpful comments for each target
- Make targets should be idempotent where possible

**Example Makefile Structure:**
```makefile
.PHONY: dev test build docker-up docker-down migrate-up migrate-down clean

docker-up:
	cd docker && docker-compose up -d

docker-down:
	cd docker && docker-compose down

build:
	cd backend && go build -o bin/server ./cmd/server
	cd frontend && npm run build

# ... additional targets
```

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Frontend | Backend | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| Components | PascalCase | - | `UserProfile.svelte` |
| Hooks | camelCase with 'use' | - | `useAuth.ts` |
| API Routes | - | kebab-case | `/api/user-profile` |
| Database Tables | - | snake_case | `user_profiles` |
| Go Functions | - | PascalCase (exported) / camelCase (private) | `CreateTenant()`, `validateEmail()` |
| TypeScript Functions | camelCase | - | `formatDate()` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |

### Project Structure Notes

This story establishes the foundational structure that ALL future development depends on. The structure must precisely match the unified project structure specification to ensure:
- AI agents can locate files correctly
- Build tools and scripts function properly
- Developer environment setup is consistent
- Future stories can reference standard locations

**No conflicts found** between epic requirements and architecture specifications.

## Testing

### Testing Standards for This Story

**Test Organization:**

For this story, focus on **infrastructure validation** rather than unit tests:

1. **Docker Service Verification:**
   - All services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Meilisearch) must start without errors
   - Health checks must pass for each service
   - Services must be accessible on their designated ports

2. **Backend Connection Validation:**
   - Backend must successfully connect to PostgreSQL and log connection
   - Backend must successfully connect to Redis and log connection
   - Backend must successfully connect to Meilisearch and log connection
   - Connection failures must be logged with clear error messages

3. **Build Verification:**
   - Backend: `go build ./cmd/server` must complete without errors
   - Frontend: `npm run build` must complete without errors
   - No build warnings or errors should be present

**Testing Framework Setup:**
- Backend Testing: Go Testing (standard library) + Testify 1.9+
- Frontend Testing: Vitest 1.x + Svelte Testing Library 4.x
- Note: Actual test files not required for this story, but frameworks should be configured

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Manual Verification Steps:**
1. Run `docker-compose up -d` and verify all services start
2. Run backend and check logs show successful connections
3. Build frontend and verify no errors
4. Verify repository structure matches specification

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Score: 85/100 - GOOD**

Implementation demonstrates clean, idiomatic code with strong adherence to Go and TypeScript best practices. The foundational architecture is solid with proper separation of concerns (config, database, utils). All tech stack versions match or exceed specifications. Code is well-organized, maintainable, and production-ready with minor improvements needed.

**Strengths**:
- Clean separation of concerns across all layers
- Comprehensive error handling with context wrapping
- Structured JSON logging with Zap
- Excellent Docker configuration with health checks
- Strong documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING)
- Proper environment variable configuration pattern
- Graceful shutdown implementation

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Testing framework setup incomplete (frontend missing Vitest/Testing Library)
- Security: Default credentials in config.go need improvement
- Connection pool configuration not externalized
- Minor error handling gaps (Redis Close)

### Refactoring Performed

Quinn performed 4 critical refactorings to improve code quality and security:

1. **File**: frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte
   - **Change**: Removed non-existent favicon reference, added proper HTML meta tags (charset, viewport, title)
   - **Why**: Original code referenced `$lib/assets/favicon.svg` that doesn't exist, causing build/runtime errors. Missing meta tags harm accessibility and mobile rendering.
   - **How**: Removed favicon import, added `<meta charset="utf-8" />`, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`, and `<title>IronArchive</title>` to svelte:head block
   - **Impact**: Prevents build errors, improves WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance

2. **File**: backend/cmd/server/main.go (Redis Close handling)
   - **Change**: Fixed deferred Redis Close() to properly handle returned error
   - **Why**: Original code used `defer redisConn.Close()` which ignores the error return value, violating Go error handling best practices
   - **How**: Changed to `defer func() { if err := redisConn.Close(); err != nil { logger.Warn(...) } }()` to log close errors
   - **Impact**: Improves error observability during shutdown

3. **File**: backend/internal/utils/logger.go
   - **Change**: Added explicit default case to log level switch statement
   - **Why**: Invalid log levels were falling through silently to info level without indication
   - **How**: Added `default:` case with comment explaining fallback to info level behavior
   - **Impact**: Improves code clarity and maintainability

4. **File**: backend/cmd/server/main.go (maskConnectionString function)
   - **Change**: Replaced simplistic string masking with proper URL parsing to mask only passwords
   - **Why**: Original implementation could expose credentials in the middle of connection strings, creating security risk
   - **How**: Implemented URL parsing to detect `user:password@host` and `password@host` patterns, masks only password component while preserving debugging context (protocol, user, host)
   - **Impact**: Significantly improved security while maintaining debuggability

**Build Verification**: All refactorings tested - backend builds successfully (Go 1.24), frontend builds successfully (Vite 7.1), no runtime errors introduced.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS - All naming conventions followed, proper error handling, environment variable access through config layer
- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS - Perfect alignment with unified-project-structure.md specification
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ CONCERNS - Frontend testing framework (Vitest + Testing Library) not configured per story requirements. Backend missing Testify dependency.
- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (8.5/9) - AC 1-7 fully met, AC 8 manual verification only, AC 9 fully met

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by QA** (checked):
- [x] Fixed frontend favicon reference and added HTML meta tags (frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte)
- [x] Fixed Redis Close error handling (backend/cmd/server/main.go)
- [x] Added logger default case (backend/internal/utils/logger.go)
- [x] Improved maskConnectionString security (backend/cmd/server/main.go)

**Recommended for Dev** (unchecked):
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add frontend testing framework (Vitest 1.x + @testing-library/svelte 4.x to package.json)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add backend testing framework (Testify 1.9+ to go.mod)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Improve config.go security - change default credentials to empty strings for required fields
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add connection pool configuration (MaxConns, IdleTimeout) to Config struct
- [ ] **LOW**: Externalize timeout configuration (currently hardcoded 5s for Meilisearch)
- [ ] **LOW**: Add Docker resource limits (CPU/memory) to docker-compose.yml
- [ ] **OPTIONAL**: Consider adding retry logic for transient connection failures (future story)

### Security Review

**Status: CONCERNS (70/100)**

**Issues Found**:
1. **MEDIUM** (backend/internal/config/config.go:30-39): Default values contain functional connection strings (`postgres://ironarchive:ironarchive_password@localhost...`)
   - **Risk**: If .env not configured, uses predictable credentials
   - **Addressed**: ✗ Not fixed (requires behavior change decision)
   - **Recommendation**: Change defaults to empty strings, force explicit configuration

2. **LOW** (backend/cmd/server/main.go:120-153): Connection string masking
   - **Risk**: Could expose passwords in logs
   - **Addressed**: ✓ Fixed by Quinn (refactoring #4)
   - **Status**: Now properly masks only password component

3. **INFO** (docker/docker-compose.yml): Hardcoded Docker credentials
   - **Risk**: Development credentials in version control
   - **Addressed**: ✓ Acceptable for dev environment, documented
   - **Status**: No action required

**Positive Security Practices**:
- ✓ Environment variable configuration pattern
- ✓ .env files excluded from version control
- ✓ Improved password masking in logs
- ✓ No secrets in application code

### Performance Considerations

**Status: GOOD (85/100)**

**Strengths**:
- ✓ PostgreSQL connection pooling (pgxpool) for efficient connections
- ✓ Async context patterns for cancellation
- ✓ Efficient Docker networking (bridge mode)
- ✓ Fast startup with parallel connection validation

**Opportunities**:
- Connection pool not tuned (using pgxpool defaults)
- No Docker resource limits (acceptable for dev)
- Timeout values hardcoded (5s Meilisearch) - should be configurable

**Assessment**: Performance foundation is solid. Pool tuning can be addressed when load characteristics are known.

### Files Modified During Review

Quinn modified the following files during refactoring (Dev to update File List):

1. `frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Fixed favicon, added HTML meta tags
2. `backend/cmd/server/main.go` - Fixed Redis Close error handling, improved maskConnectionString security, added strings import
3. `backend/internal/utils/logger.go` - Added logger default case

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-scaffolding.yml

**Rationale**: Foundation is solid with 8.5/9 ACs met and clean implementation, but testing framework setup gap violates story requirements. Security improvements recommended.

Detailed assessments:
- **Risk Profile**: docs/qa/assessments/1.1-risk-20251017.md (generated in gate file)
- **NFR Assessment**: Embedded in gate file (Security: 70/100 CONCERNS, Performance: 85/100 PASS, Reliability: 80/100 PASS, Maintainability: 90/100 PASS)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See Unchecked Items Above**

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Add testing framework dependencies (HIGH priority) - required by story
2. Address security default credentials (MEDIUM priority)
3. Optional improvements (LOW priority) can be deferred to future stories

**Story Owner Decision**: Team should decide whether to:
- **Option A**: Address HIGH items (testing frameworks) before marking Done - maintains test-driven development standards
- **Option B**: Accept testing framework gap as technical debt, track in TD-1/TD-5, proceed to Done - unblocks progress

**Quinn's Recommendation**: Option A - Testing frameworks are foundational and take minimal time to configure (~30 minutes total). Deferring creates friction for all future development stories.

### Security Review

**Status: PASS (90/100)**

Security posture significantly improved from previous review (70/100 → 90/100).

**Issues Resolved**:
1. ✓ **FIXED**: Default configuration credentials now use empty strings with explicit validation (SEC-001)
2. ✓ **FIXED**: Required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, MEILISEARCH_URL, MEILI_MASTER_KEY, JWT_SECRET) enforced with validation errors
3. ✓ **MAINTAINED**: Connection string password masking working correctly (from previous Quinn refactoring)

**Remaining Low-Risk Items**:
- **INFO** (docker/docker-compose.yml): Development credentials in version control - Acceptable for dev environment, properly documented

**Security Best Practices Confirmed**:
- ✓ Configuration fails fast if required secrets missing
- ✓ Environment variable configuration pattern enforced
- ✓ .env files excluded from version control (.gitignore)
- ✓ Password masking prevents credential leakage in logs
- ✓ No secrets in application code
- ✓ Docker services isolated via dedicated network

### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT (85/100)**

No changes from previous review - performance foundation remains solid.

**Strengths**:
